# CodeLogician

## Concepts
- CodeLogician: agent that utilize IML/ImandraX to reason about programs and their properties (specifications).
- IML (Imandra Modeling Language), a formalized Higher-Order subset of OCaml extended with theorem proving tactics and verification annotations. ImandraX is the reasoning engine that powers IML.
- Verification: a process of proving a goal (some properties) or finding a counter-example if the goal is not satisfied. The process can be fully automated or interactive (guided with tactics).
- Region decomposition is a powerful feature of ImandraX for analyzing the state-space of functions. It automatically partitions a function’s input domain into disjoint regions, each characterized by a set of constraints and a corresponding simplified invariant behavior of the function within that region. Test cases can be further generated from these regions.
- `codelogician` / `codelogician-lite` CLI: the preferred way for file-system-based agents to interact with ImandraX through LLM-friendly interface.

## Typical workflow when working with IML
- Write IML code, corresponding to your specification or program to be verified / tested. Admit IML code with ImandraX and correct type errors if any.
- Based on requirements, resort to corresponding commands or annotations to invoke ImandraX:
  - Option 1. Verification (prove a goal or find a counter-example)
    - Use `verify <func>` / `instance <func>`, which are dual to each other, with the former attempts to prove the goal and return a counter-example if it fails, and the latter attempts to find a counter-example and return it if it succeeds.
    - For more general theorem proving, especially with tactics, use `theorem <name> <vars> = <body>`, `lemma <name> <vars> = <body>`, and `axiom <name> <vars> = <body>`.
  - Option 2. Region decomposition / Enumerative analysis / Test-case generation
    - Use `[@@decomp top <decomp-args> ()]` attached to function definitions to invoke region decomposition.
    - Generate test cases (Python or TypeScript) from regions with subcommands in `codelogician` CLI.

- To type-check, invoke verification, or invoke region decomposition, you pass your IML code to ImandraX via `codelogician-lite` CLI. `codelogician-lite` CLI is designed to be used by file-system-based agents with a LLM-friendly interface.
  - The most important and frequently used subcommand is `check [IML-FILE]`, which tries to type-check and admit all structures in the file.
  - Use `check-vg` / `check-decomp` with `--index` option to pass specific VGs or decompositions to check (after `check` emits no errors).


## Getting started

To get started up to speed with IML, read the top-level guide on [IML syntax](iml-syntax.md) and the `codelogician-lite` CLI ([codelogician-cli.md](codelogician-cli.md)). That should be enough to equipped you with the knowledge to write IML code and learn-by-doing. 

Check out import syntax for modular development.

Only when encountering tasks related to verification, region-decomp, or tactic-based proofs, refer to corresponding guides.

Tips: 
- A tip for explorative development is to use heredoc to pass a IML snippet to `check` for quick testing. For example:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | codelogician-lite check -
let f x = x + 1
EOF
```
